# Battery Terminal Manufacturing Guide

> [!TIP]
> For reference, here is a [3D model of the original LEV50 cell](https://www.printables.com/model/1011773-lev50-cell-complete/) that can be shared with manufacturers to illustrate the desired terminal design.

## Terminal Design Requirements

### Critical Specifications

- **Terminal Surface**: Must be perfectly flat with no steps, ridges, or weld marks surrounding the studs
- **Stud Size**:
  - 5-6mm studs are sufficient (8mm is not required)
  - Original LEV50 cells used 8mm studs
  - Both 5mm and 6mm studs are used in higher power applications successfully

### Terminal Structure

- Must have a simple, flat terminal face similar to stock LEV50 cells
- No surrounding steps or raised sections around the stud
- Stud should rise cleanly from a flat surface
- Avoid custom modifications to standard terminal designs

### Manufacturing Considerations

1. **Stud Welding**
   - Studs must be properly welded to the aluminum cell terminals
   - Welds must be strong enough to withstand torquing forces
   - Avoid requesting custom stud sizes as this may compromise weld quality

2. **Surface Finish**
   - Terminal face must be flat and smooth
   - No weld ridges or surface irregularities
   - Must provide good contact with bus bars

3. **Quality Control**
   - Test terminal strength before bulk ordering
   - Verify consistent terminal dimensions across sample cells
   - Check torque specifications and terminal integrity

## Common Issues to Avoid

1. **Stepped Terminals**
   - Creates alignment problems with bus bars
   - Requires additional spacers/washers
   - Complicates CMU connections

2. **Custom Modifications**
   - Can lead to inconsistent quality
   - May compromise terminal strength
   - Often requires workarounds for fitment

## Testing and Validation

Before bulk ordering:

1. Request sample cells for evaluation
2. Test terminal strength with specified torque values
3. Verify compatibility with bus bars and CMU connections
4. Perform capacity testing if possible
   - Document discharge amp rate used
   - Record upper/lower voltage limits
   - Compare against manufacturer specifications
